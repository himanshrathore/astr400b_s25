Some general points:

1) For identifying shapes of DM halos: contours are fine if you just want to visualize the shapes. For quantifying them (like axis ratios), you would need to fit ellipses and extract the properties of ellipses. The python library photutils can do this. Talk to us. Same can be done to pick out the stellar bar.

2) For kinematics: you can also compute the rotation curve by binning the stars in polar coordinates (in both position and velocity) and computing average v_phi as a function of R. Talk to us. For stellar velocity dispersion, you need to specifiy which component you are calculating, or if you are calculating the total velocity dispersion. You need to decide the radius within which you want to compute the velocity dispersion. The half-mass radius is a good choice for this.

3) For analysis of the merger remnant: you need to consider both MW and M31 particles. The bulge particles in the MW and M31 may not end up being in the bulge of the remnant (if it has a bulge).

4) For streams: you need to be clear on how you will identify the stream. A good way to do this is to select particles that reside outside the Jacobi radius.

5) For center of mass: make sure you use the iterative shrinking sphere method and not the direct mass weighted average.
